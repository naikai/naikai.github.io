I'll keep this very short, but welcome to my github profile website, it has this blog page here and my resume. That's pretty much it. I wanted to keep it super simple, and just an extension of what I had on github. It was important to do this without iframes, and I wanted to do all the coding (except libraries) myself. 

## Working Bits

If someone wanted to use this code, they would find that the resume, vcard and blog data would be changed in `/data` where the style sheets are in `/static/css`. Adding to `/data/manifest.html` will add items to the menu at the top of the page. In order to add a post, currently you have to add a javascript line in index.html but Iâ€™d like to change that.
