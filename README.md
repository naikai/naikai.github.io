# David Molik github website: status-five.github.io
## Design Philosophy
I wanted to make a Github website that was an extension of Github more than it was a separate entity, however, I wanted to do this without the use of Iframes. 
## Working Bits
If someone wanted to use this code, they would find that the resume, vcard and blog data would be changed in /data where the style sheets are in /static/css
